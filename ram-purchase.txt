Per our RAM Purchase Policy we are required to give seven days notice for any RAM purchases that are not directly tied to account name purchases. This serves as notice that EOS New York plans to purchase 100 KiB of RAM on 12 October 2018 as part of our sponsorship for the Chintai resource leasing platform.
